## 🎯 DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### **1. Interface-Driven Design**
Every major component implements a clear interface:
- `IGameModeManager` for game modes
- `IWeaponManager` for weapons
- `IMovementController` for movement

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Loose coupling
- ✅ Easy testing (mocking)
- ✅ Swappable implementations
- ✅ Clear contracts

### **2. Single Responsibility**
Each component has ONE clear purpose:
- `GameModeManager` → Manages game modes ONLY
- `WeaponManager` → Manages weapons ONLY
- `MovementController` → Handles movement ONLY

### **3. Type Safety**
Everything is strongly typed:
- No `any` types (except where absolutely necessary)
- Strict TypeScript mode
- Comprehensive type definitions

### **4. Event-Driven**
Components communicate via events:
- `onModeChange(callback)` → Game mode changes
- `onShoot(callback)` → Weapon fires
- `onJump(callback)` → Player jumps

### **5. Testability**
- Unit tests for every function
- Integration tests for component interaction
- E2E tests for complete user flows

---

## 🚀 USAGE

### **Basic Setup:**
```typescript
import UltimateFPSGame from './components/games/fps/ultimate/UltimateFPSGame'

// In your React component
export default function GamePage() {
  return <UltimateFPSGame />
}
```

### **Game Mode Management:**
```typescript
import { GameModeManager } from './core/GameModeManager'

const manager = new GameModeManager()

// Change mode
manager.changeMode('team-deathmatch')

// Listen to changes
manager.onModeChange((mode) => {
  console.log(`Mode changed to: ${mode}`)
})

// Get config
const config = manager.getModeConfig()
console.log(config.maxPlayers) // 16
```

### **Weapon Management:**
```typescript
import { WeaponManager } from './weapons/WeaponManager'

const weaponMgr = new WeaponManager()

// Switch weapon
weaponMgr.switchWeapon(1)

// Shoot
const result = weaponMgr.shoot()
if (result?.hit) {
  console.log(`Hit ${result.entityType}!`)
}

// Reload
await weaponMgr.reload()
```

### **Movement:**
```typescript
import { MovementController } from './movement/MovementController'

const movement = new MovementController()

// Sprint
movement.sprint(true)

// Slide
if (movement.canSlide()) {
  movement.slide()
}

// Jump
if (movement.canJump()) {
  movement.jump()
}
```

## 🎓 CODING STANDARDS

### **TypeScript:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Proper types
function shoot(weapon: Weapon): HitResult | undefined {
  if (!canShoot(weapon)) {
    return undefined
  }
  
  return {
    hit: true,
    damage: weapon.damage,
    distance: 10
  }
}

// ❌ BAD: Any types
function shoot(weapon: any): any {
  return weapon.damage
}
```

### **Error Handling:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Proper error handling
function changeMode(mode: GameMode): void {
  if (!this.isValidMode(mode)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid game mode: ${mode}`)
  }
  
  try {
    this.cleanupCurrentMode()
    this._currentMode = mode
    this.initializeMode(mode)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Mode change failed:', error)
    throw error
  }
}

// ❌ BAD: No error handling
function changeMode(mode: GameMode): void {
  this._currentMode = mode
}
```

### **Documentation:**
```typescript
/**
 * Change the game mode
 * 
 * @param mode - The new game mode to switch to
 * @throws {Error} If mode is invalid
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * manager.changeMode('team-deathmatch')
 * ```
 */
changeMode(mode: GameMode): void {
  // Implementation...
}
```
